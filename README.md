## Description

Flappy Bird is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a bird, attempting to navigate it through a series of pipes. The bird flaps its wings to stay airborne, and the player must time the flaps correctly to avoid colliding with the pipes. The game gets progressively more challenging as the bird advances, and the objective is to achieve the highest score possible.

## Features

- Simple and addictive gameplay.
- Randomized pipe generation for varied challenges.
- Keeps track of the player's score.
- Game over screen with an option to restart the game.

## Technologies Used

The game is built using the following technology:

- Python
- Pygame module (for game development)

2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flappy-bird-game.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd flappy-bird-game`
4. Install the required Pygame module: `pip install pygame`

## Usage

1. Run the `flappy_bird.py` script: `python flappy_bird.py`
2. The game window will open, and the Flappy Bird game will start.
